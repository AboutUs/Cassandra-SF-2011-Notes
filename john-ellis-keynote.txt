- Cassandra is big data.
- why people choose Cassandra
 - big data
 - durable
 - integrated caching
   - solves cache coherence problem
   - no need to cache data elsewhere
   - long and short: row caching
 - performance.
   - no write locks
   - streaming IO from memtable to disk
 - eventually consistent? Nope. Can be fully consistent if you want.
   - can tune availability vs consistency
   - eventual consistency really is across data centers.
   - data sent across to other data center to one replica, not many.
 - expiring columns
   - redis-like
- 0.8
 - CQL
   - higher level experience
 - Counters (summing)
 - automatic tuning
 - bulk load
Onward to 1.0!
- release in October
- polish
 - repair
   - syncs data
   - exchanges hashes
 - compression
 - optimize reads
- read performance
 - CQL: Cassandra goes relational

Post-1.0
- less thrift!
- brisk
 - analytics sans etl
